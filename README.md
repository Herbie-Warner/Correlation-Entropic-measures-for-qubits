#Main

Completed to aid investigation into holographic discord. These python files were to aid in verifying particular inequalities before attempting to prove anything of length.
Below are some examples for correlation/entropic measures are computable with this codebase.
`D_W(A|B)`
`D(A|B)`
`J_W(A|B)`
`J(A|B)`
`S_R(A:B)`
`I(A:B)`
`E_f(A:B)`
Other operations exist such as different types of purification and density matrix index permutation. 
Note I use 1-based indexing. Sorry!
Will upload paper reference once published for some clearer definitions and results.
